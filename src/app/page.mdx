# Introduction

Project Fuso is a fork of [illumos](https://illumos.org/), which in turn is a fork of OpenSolaris.

This is an attempt to create a modernized operating system that is more similar to other popular systems (GNU/Linux and BSDs), while keeping all the good technologies (ZFS, Zones, DTrace etc).

# Why the name "Fuso"?

扶桑(Fu Sang in Chinese, or ふそう(Fusō) in Japanese) is the divine tree in Chinese mythology from where the **Sun** rises.

# Great! How can I get this system?
